        <h1>Little Fish - Animated Music/Lyric Video</h1>
        <iframe class="youtube-embed" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FR_n7_dB_QA?list=RDFR_n7_dB_QA" title="Hip-Oh! - Come Together - Cover/Promo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This was my first (and really, only successful) attempt at creating an animation of sorts. I spent weeks in Adobe After Effects attempting to make something that was far above what my computer skills were capable of at the time. <br>
            The process involved drawing things on my iPad in Adobe Fresco and making sure that I organized the layers in a way that would allow me to tie individual elements of a character to a keyframe in After Effects.<br>
            I then watched hours of tutorials about how to use the camera within a 3d space so that I could have the lyrics sort of exist within a predefined space. <br>
            None of this was made with any kind of prior understanding about how After Effects worked at the time, so I learned a lot, and leaned heavily into mistakes if I thought they created an interesting effect.
