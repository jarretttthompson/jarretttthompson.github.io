    <p>This was easily the most fun I have ever had in the recording studio. Bullmoose was a fantastic project that was the brainchild of my friend  <a

    This was one of the first and only times I've ever really been in a studio with a selection of songs that I knew really well, and could play the absolute hell out of.</p>

  <p>This was the second release that birdperson did. The fun thing about this one is that the band got upset that I was quitting to do something else, so I'm not credited on the album even though I most certainly did write and record the drums for this project.</p>

  <p>The first time I had ever been in a recording studio was in Alpharetta, GA in 2017. This was a sort of math-rock/emo project I was in that did two little diy tours up the coast and through the midwest.</p>
